# DIY-smd-Soldering-Station

First of all, I would like to thank Manolena (https://github.com/manolena/DIY-SMD-Soldering-Station) , for his all improvments has made, at the first circuit of Matthias idea (https://debugginglab.wordpress.com/2014/10/30/soldering-station/).
It is an smd soldering station consist of an arduino mega (core version) and some other component ,for controlling temp at a 5$ soldering iron using ptc,ntc or k type thermocouple. In my case i use only ptc soldering iron. 
I also made a 3d printed case ,to fit in all parts together.
